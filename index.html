            <p>I’m a multi-disciplinary designer based in Northern Virginia and have spent my career connecting the dots between mission, intelligence, and technology to accelerate government innovation. The convergence of disruptive technologies offers endless opportunity to create and learn from others, and I am passionate about empowering you to do the same through design.
            </p>
            <p>Previous lives in visual art, language, and research have all shaped my interest in user-centered design, and while I look to past experience for inspiration, I draw on human interactions and empathy to create meaningful experiences and solve problems.
